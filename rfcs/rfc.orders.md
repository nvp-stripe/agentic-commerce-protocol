# RFC: Enhanced Order Support

**Status:** Draft
**Version:** 2026-02-05
**Scope:** Rich post-purchase order tracking with fulfillments and adjustments

This RFC enhances the existing `Order` schema with rich post-purchase lifecycle
tracking, enabling agents to provide detailed order status updates, shipment
tracking, and refund visibility to buyers.

---

## 1. Scope & Goals

- Enable **per-line-item tracking** with `quantity.ordered`, `quantity.current`, and `quantity.fulfilled`
- Provide **fulfillment tracking** for shipping, pickup, and digital delivery
- Support **fulfillment events** as an append-only log of delivery progress
- Track **adjustments** for refunds, credits, returns, and disputes
- Maintain **backward compatibility** by making all new fields optional

**Out of scope:** Order management APIs (create, update, cancel orders via API),
inventory management, returns authorization flows.

---

## 2. Motivation

### 2.1 Agent Use Cases

Agents need to answer post-purchase questions:

| Question | Required Data |
|----------|---------------|
| "Where's my order?" | `fulfillments[]` with tracking info and events |
| "What did I order?" | `line_items[]` with product details |
| "Which items shipped?" | `line_items[].quantity.fulfilled` and fulfillment line item refs |
| "Did I get a refund?" | `adjustments[]` with status |
| "When will it arrive?" | `fulfillments[].estimated_delivery` and event history |

### 2.2 What This Enhancement Adds

This enhancement introduces:

- **OrderLineItem** — Per-item tracking with quantity breakdown
- **Fulfillment** — Delivery method tracking (shipping, pickup, digital)
- **FulfillmentEvent** — Point-in-time delivery events
- **Adjustment** — Post-order changes (refunds, returns, credits)
- **Order Totals** — Order-level financial summary (reuses checkout `Total` schema)

---

## 3. Design Philosophy

### 3.1 Progressive Enrichment

All new fields are optional. Merchants can start with the existing minimal Order
response and progressively add richer data as their systems support it:

**Minimal order (existing):**
```json
{
  "id": "ord_123",
  "checkout_session_id": "cs_456",
  "permalink_url": "https://merchant.com/orders/123"
}
```

**Rich order (with new fields):**
```json
{
  "id": "ord_123",
  "checkout_session_id": "cs_456",
  "permalink_url": "https://merchant.com/orders/123",
  "line_items": [...],
  "fulfillments": [...],
  "adjustments": [...],
  "totals": [{ "type": "total", "display_text": "Total", "amount": 15342 }]
}
```

### 3.2 Clear Quantity Semantics

The `quantity` object uses a 3-field model:

| Field | Meaning | Mutable? |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `ordered` | Quantity originally ordered | No (immutable) |
| `current` | Active quantity on the order (may decrease via cancellations/returns) | Yes |
| `fulfilled` | Quantity that has been fulfilled (shipped, picked up, or digitally delivered) | Yes (increases over time) |

**Status derivation from quantity:**
- `removed` if `current == 0`
- `fulfilled` if `fulfilled == current`
- `partial` if `0 < fulfilled < current`
- `processing` otherwise

### 3.3 Fulfillments, Not Shipments

We use `fulfillments[]` rather than `shipments[]` to cover:

- **Shipping** — Physical carrier delivery (with `carrier`, `tracking_number`, `tracking_url`)
- **Pickup** — In-store, curbside, locker pickup (with `ready_for_pickup` status)
- **Digital** — Download links, license keys, streaming access (with `digital_delivery` sub-object)

---

- `ready_for_pickup` — Ready for customer pickup
- `delivered` — Successfully delivered
- `failed` — Delivery failed
- `canceled` — Fulfillment canceled

**Status applicability by fulfillment type:**

Not all statuses apply to all fulfillment types. Merchants SHOULD only use
applicable statuses for each type:

| Status | shipping | pickup | digital |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| `pending` | yes | yes | yes |

### 4.6 Order Totals

Order-level totals reuse the existing `Total` schema from the checkout spec.
`Order.totals` is a `Total[]` array, the same shape used on checkout sessions,
line items, and fulfillment options.

This means agents parsing checkout and order responses can use the same code
path for totals extraction.

**Order-relevant `Total.type` values:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `subtotal` | Sum of line item subtotals |
| `fulfillment` | Shipping / delivery cost |
| `tax` | Tax amount |
| `discount` | Total discount |
| `total` | Original order total as charged at checkout |
| `amount_refunded` | Total amount refunded to buyer (sum of completed refund adjustments) |

The `amount_refunded` type is new for post-purchase tracking. All other types
are shared with checkout totals.

**Note on `total` semantics:** The entry with `type: "total"` always represents
the original charged amount at checkout, before any post-order adjustments
(refunds, credits, etc.). This allows agents to surface both numbers
unambiguously: "Your order was $670.99 and you've been refunded $325.16."
Agents SHOULD NOT subtract adjustments from `total` to derive a net amount.

## 6. Order Retrieval API

### 6.1 GET /orders/{order_id}

Returns the current-state snapshot of an order. The response is the full `Order`
object — the same schema used in webhook payloads.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Method | `GET` |
| Path | `/orders/{order_id}` |
| Auth | Bearer token (same as checkout session endpoints) |
| Response | `200` with full `Order` object, or `404` if not found |

This endpoint complements the webhook push model. Use cases:

- **Reconciliation** — Verify order state if a webhook was missed or delayed
- **On-demand status** — Agent checks order status in response to a buyer question
- **Recovery** — Re-sync after a consumer restart or outage

The response is always a **current-state snapshot** (not incremental deltas),
identical in shape to what webhooks deliver.

---

## 7. Webhook Events

Order updates are sent via the existing Order webhook mechanism. When sending
order updates, merchants MUST include the full order object (not incremental
deltas). All optional Order fields (`line_items`, `fulfillments`, `adjustments`,
`totals`) SHOULD be included when available.

### 6.1 Webhook Schema

The `EventDataOrder` schema in `openapi.agentic_checkout_webhook.yaml` composes
the full `Order` schema via `$ref`. This means all Order fields are accepted in
webhook payloads. The `type: "order"` discriminator field MUST be included in
webhook payloads.

### 6.2 Replacement of `refunds[]` with `adjustments[]`

The legacy `refunds[]` field and `Refund` schema have been **removed** from the
webhook spec. The `adjustments[]` array on the Order schema is the only
supported mechanism for representing refunds, credits, returns, disputes, and
other post-order changes in webhook payloads.

Existing integrations that previously used `refunds[]` MUST migrate to
`adjustments[]` with `type: "refund"` or `type: "credit"` as appropriate.

---

## 7. Implementation Notes

### 7.1 Status Derivation

Merchants MAY derive `status` fields from the quantity fields:

**Line item status:**
```
if (current == 0) → "removed"
if (fulfilled == current) → "fulfilled"
if (fulfilled > 0 && fulfilled < current) → "partial"
else → "processing"
```

**Order status:**
```
if (order just received) → "created"
if (held for review) → "manual_review"
if (all line items removed) → "canceled"
if (all fulfillments delivered) → "completed"
if (all line items fulfilled but not all delivered) → "shipped"
if (any line item in progress) → "processing"
else → "confirmed"
```

### 7.2 Backward Compatibility

Existing integrations that only read `id`, `checkout_session_id`, and
`permalink_url` will continue to work. New fields are additive.

### 7.3 Empty Arrays

An empty `fulfillments: []` array means no fulfillment tracking is available.
An empty `adjustments: []` array means no post-order changes have occurred.

---

## 8. Change Log

- **2026-04-23**: Add GET /orders/{order_id} endpoint for on-demand order retrieval
- **2026-04-23**: Post-checkout alignment — 3-field quantity model (`ordered`/`current`/`fulfilled`), line item status (`processing`/`partial`/`fulfilled`/`removed`), order status `delivered`→`completed`, fulfillment event types (add `canceled`/`undeliverable`, rename `returned`→`returned_to_sender`), adjustment types (merge `refund`+`partial_refund`, rename `store_credit`→`credit`, add `price_adjustment`, merge `chargeback` into `dispute`)
- **2026-02-11**: Totals alignment — Replaced flat `OrderTotals` object with `Total[]` array (reusing checkout spec's `Total` schema); added `amount_refunded` to `Total.type` enum
- **2026-02-10**: Review feedback — Extended Order.status enum (`created`, `manual_review`); added `amount_refunded` to OrderTotals; documented `total` as original charge amount; added `digital_delivery` sub-object to Fulfillment; added `ready_for_pickup` status; documented per-type status applicability; clarified `Adjustment.amount` as tax-inclusive; updated webhook spec to compose Order via `$ref`; removed `refunds[]` in favor of `adjustments[]`
- **2026-02-05**: Initial draft — Added OrderLineItem, Fulfillment, FulfillmentEvent, Adjustment, OrderTotals schemas
